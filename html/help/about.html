    <p>We spend so much of our time selecting, improving and maintaining the place we call home.</p>
    <p>Buying a home is a major milestone. Since sharing milestones is such a big part of our everyday lives, we created a free platform to tell the story of our homes — room by room, year by year, before and after projects — in a fun and easy way.</p>
    <p>
      Glossre can be used to:
      <ul>
        <li>Capture, curate and share your home</li>
        <li>Seek real solutions from real friends to real problems in your home</li>
        <li>Provide help to friends’ and neighbors’ homes</li>
        <li>Memorialize before/after conditions for home improvement projects</li>
        <li>Document conditions for insurance purposes</li>
        <li>Search new homes curated by users like you</li>
        <li>Build an audience vested in your home's value</li>
        <li>Stay permanently in touch with your real estate agent</li>
        <li>Create great marketing pieces for your real estate agent when it’s time to change homes</li>
      </ul>

        <em>We all live somewhere. In fact, most of us live in several places during our lifetimes. The U.S. census counted over 100 million households in 2010, and the number just keeps growing. Every year, 40 million Americans move from one place to another.</em>

        <em>New housing is built; old structures are torn down. Our residential built environment is always in flux. We are owners and renters; we live temporarily in dormitories, nursing homes, and shelters; we move into larger spaces; we downsize.</em>

        <em>Having some sort of lodging is a basic necessity, though whether or not we consider the place where we sleep to be “home” can be more complicated. The American home has been shaped by transformations in technology, changes in government policy, and consumer culture over many centuries. How we build our houses and the ways in which we understand the multiple meanings of home are the subjects of this exhibition...</em>
