    How does Glossre work?
    <div class='divider'></div>
  </h1>
  <p>Glossre’s mobile web app enables you to upload or take photographs of a space and quickly organize them by area. Glossre allows you to then curate an interactive slideshow by adding in-photo tags, sharable and with friends via Glossre, Facebook, Twitter or just plain email. You can also print specific slides to a PDF brochure if you want a hard copy or prefer a non-interactive presentation of your space.</p>

    Is sharing my address with Glossre required?
    <div class='divider'></div>
  </h1>
  <p>No. Sharing your address is optional. Privacy is important to us, so please rest assured we will never compromise your privacy by revealing your address in the event you do choose to share it with us. You may, of course, choose to display your address publicly, by naming your space accordingly, particularly if you are using your Glossre Page&trade; to help sell your home.</p>

    What is Glossre’s approach to privacy?
    <div class='divider'></div>
  </h1>
  <p>Glossre believes in reclaiming the image of your home that probably already exists online.  Homes have a digital footprint populated by the local tax assessor, previous listings or even the street view on a mapping app.  If you and/or your home are going to be searched, the result should be the image you want to project of this very important facet of your life. At a minimum, the front door view of your house should be the view you want snoopers to see. By default, your information can only be seen by your friends, or Homeys&trade; as we call them.</p>
