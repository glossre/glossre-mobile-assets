    11. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement
  </p>
  <p>
    We will try work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with Site, including services purchased or accessed through the Site, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department. However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer's satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    You and Company agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Site, including services purchased or accessed through the Site, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other contractual relationship between you and Company.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you desire to assert a claim against Company, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Company should be addressed to: Glossre, 570 Lincoln Ave., Suite #5, Winnetka, Illinois 60093 ("Notice Address"). If Company desires to assert a claim against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Company, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Company and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association at www.adr.org. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them from us by writing to us at the Notice Address. The parties will mutually agree upon an arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Use. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of these Terms of Use, including this arbitration agreement. Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Cook County, Illinois. The payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any. However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys' fees, or if there is a written agreement providing for payment or recovery attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to the prevailing party, under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois.
  </p>
  <p style='font-weight: bold; margin-top: 15px;'>
    12. Revisions; General
  </p>
  <p>
    Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of this Site, with or without cause, and with or without notice. In the event that any of the Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between Company and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof. In its sole discretion, Company may from time-to-time revise these Terms of Use by updating this posting. You should, therefore, periodically visit this page to review the current Terms of Use, so you are aware of any such revisions to which you are bound. Certain provisions of these Terms of Use may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages within this Site.
